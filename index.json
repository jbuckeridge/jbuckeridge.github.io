It was a fascinating read, packed full of information on myth, magic, philosophy and science. What really struck me was how much science of the 19th century was either driven by, or related to, investigations into the occult. We\u0026rsquo;re talking about the golden era of seances, mediums, mystics and stage magicians. The great discoveries of the late 19th century: radio waves, x-rays and \u0026lsquo;cathode rays\u0026rsquo; (or electrons) all were \u0026lsquo;invisible\u0026rsquo;, and were often thought to be related to apparent psychic forces, ghosts and other paranormal phenomena.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s amazing to look back at it all now with the benefit of hindsight and question how they could have believed this stuff. Particularly interesting was the work of Sir William Crookes, who was either a crank or a dupe (or maybe both, as Ball suggests). This is Crookes, inventor of the famous radiometer, which many will have encountered in secondary school science. It turns out that he invented this device to try measure invisible, psychic forces, and seemed to believe he had been successful.\nI was pleased to learn about the book pictured here, Occult Chemistry by Annie Beasant and C. W. Leadbeater, two theosophists who basically used their imagination to come up with diagrams of atoms, the structure of which were unknown at the time. In some cases, they came up with structures remarkably similar to the common pictures of atomic orbitals we use nowadays, but they also drew some amazingly complex geometrical shapes that are unlike anything I have seen before. I love that they just assumed they could use their minds to \u0026lsquo;discover\u0026rsquo; what atoms looked like! The book also contains a picture of the periodic table from a paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, read in 1898 that I quite like:\n\r\r\rInvisible really indicates just how well scientific investigations are embedded within the sociological frameworks in which they operate. We like to think of science as being ultra-rational, beyond influence from mere human biases, but despite our best efforts it rarely is. Although the scientific method is designed to avoid such influences, its failure to do so (or the failure of its implementation, more precisely) is something we need to be aware of. I wonder what driving forces and theories for investigations into the \u0026lsquo;invisible\u0026rsquo; that science is concerned with now, will look as strange in 100 years as those of Crookes et al. in the late 1800s do today? Many-worlds interpretations?

It is assumed that the formation enthalpies of a set of variously charged point defects in thermodynamic equilibrium are known, as well as the density of electronic states in the defect-free system. By applying the constraint of overall charge neutrality, the self-consistent Fermi energy is determined using an iterative searching routine. The procedure is incorporated within a Fortran code 'SC-FERMI': the input consists of the defect formation energies, density of sites where they can form, and the degeneracy of each charge state; the material band gap; and the calculated density of states of the pristine system. The output is the self-consistent Fermi energy, the total concentrations of each defect as well as the concentration of its individual charge states, and the free carrier concentrations. Furthermore, the procedure facilitates fixing the concentration of one or more defects and determining the resulting self-consistent Fermi energy and concentrations of other defects (performed using the related code 'FROZEN-SC-FERMI'), thus modelling `frozen-in' defects which may form by kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, processes. One can fix the total concentration or the concentration of a particular charge state; it is also possible to introduce new defects with a fixed concentration, but here the charge state must be specified. The background theory is discussed in some detail, and the operation of the program is demonstrated by some examples.","tags":null,"title":"Equilibrium point defect and charge carrier concentrations in a material determined through calculation of the self-consistent Fermi energy","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Very sad to be leaving UCL after so long.

The key difficulty in the description of the dominant charged defects is determining a consistent position of the corresponding defect levels, which is difficult to derive using standard supercell calculations. In a complementary approach, we take advantage of the embedded cluster methodology that provides direct access to a common zero of the electrostatic potential for all point defects in all charge states. Charged defects polarise a host dielectric material with long-range forces that strongly affect the outcome of defect simulations; to account for the polarisation, we couple embedding with the hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach and investigate the structure, formation and ionisation energies, and equilibrium concentrations of native point defects in wurtzite GaN at a chemically accurate hybrid-density-functional-theory level. N vacancies are the most thermodynamically favourable native defects in GaN, which contribute to the n-type character of as-grown GaN but are not the main source, a result that is consistent with experiment. Our calculations show no native point defects can form thermodynamically stable acceptor states. GaN can be easily doped n-type, but, in equilibrium conditions at moderate temperatures acceptor dopants will be compensated by N vacancies and no significant hole concentrations will be observed, indicating non-equilibrium processes must dominate in p-type GaN. We identify spectroscopic signatures of native defects in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet luminescence ranges and complementary spectroscopies. Crucially, we calculate the effective-mass-like-state levels associated with electrons and holes bound in diffuse orbitals. These levels may be accessible in competition with more strongly-localised states in luminescence processes and allow the attribution of the observed 3.46 and 3.27 eV UV peaks in a broad range of GaN samples to the presence of N vacancies.","tags":null,"title":"Donor and acceptor characteristics of native point defects in GaN","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557792059,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557792059,"objectID":"be3c701d47bb1d23ab90bf33c0bbe753","permalink":"/talk/quantum-computing/","publishdate":"2019-05-14T10:00:59+10:00","relpermalink":"/talk/quantum-computing/","section":"talk","summary":"Computational materials science has been progessing at a substantial rate over the last few decades.

Many experimental observations, both optical and electronic, such as intrinsic n-type conductivity and a range of luminescence bands found in a majority of samples, have been attributed to different defect structures in the material using first-principles calculations, typically employing the periodic supercell technique to model defects. The attribution often depends on the level of density functional theory applied, with little consistency across a broad range of studies. To overcome the problems inherent in plane-wave-based defect calculations, we employ the hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical embedded cluster approach, whose main advantages are access to a common reference energy, lack of image-charge interactions and a detailed description of polarisation due to local charges in a crystal, to compute formation and ionisation energies of point defects and defect complexes in GaN. Furthermore, we calculate equilibrium Fermi energies and carrier and defect concentrations at different temperatures. Our results account for the native n-type nature of GaN as well as suggest plausible explanations for observed deep level transient spectroscopy signatures, while we discuss the unresolved problem of the source of hole carriers in p-type GaN.

We distinguish between these quantities and consider their fundamental limitations and utility for understanding material properties. We discuss the nature of bonding between atoms and the techniques that have been developed for partitioning electron density. While formal oxidation states help us count electrons (in ions, bonds, lone pairs), variously defined atomic charges are usefully employed in the description of physical processes including dielectric response and electronic spectroscopies. Such partial charges are introduced as quantitative measures in simple mechanistic models of a more complex reality, and therefore may not be comparable or transferable. In contrast, oxidation states are defined to be universal, with deviations constituting exciting challenges as evidenced in mixed-valence compounds, electrides and highly correlated systems.

Such processes are usually explained with reference to a particular defect state and often such states are studied systematically via computational techniques. The balance between different defect states, however, which may be metastable but relevant in the time-scale of optical processes, is frequently omitted from such analysis. Here we study how different configurations of electrons and holes, whether bound to defects in well-localised 'compact' states, or in extended 'diffuse' states, can alter the observed luminescence in GaN. For our calculations we employ the hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical embedded cluster method, which offers advantages over more commonly-applied supercell-based techniques when modelling defects in wide gap materials. The analysis regarding the balance between compact and diffuse states, however, is not dependent on the computational technique we employ. Our results allow us to account for various photoluminescence peaks observed routinely in doped and nominally undoped GaN samples. In particular, we attribute the 3.46 eV and 3.26 eV ultraviolet emission peaks to nitrogen vacancies binding compact and diffuse holes respectively, and describe processes related to gallium vacancy complexes that result in yellow, green and red luminescence.

Many experimental observations, both optical and electronic, such as intrinsic n-type conductivity and a range of luminescence bands found in a majority of samples, have been attributed to different defect structures in the material using first-principles calculations, typically employing the periodic supercell technique to model defects. The attribution often depends on the level of density functional theory applied, with little consistency across a broad range of studies. To overcome the problems inherent in plane-wave-based defect calculations, we employ the hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical embedded cluster approach, whose main advantages are access to a common reference energy, lack of image-charge interactions and a detailed description of polarisation due to local charges in a crystal, to compute formation and ionisation energies of point defects and defect complexes in GaN. Furthermore, we calculate equilibrium Fermi energies and carrier and defect concentrations at different temperatures. Our results account for the native n-type nature of GaN as well as suggest plausible explanations for observed deep level transient spectroscopy signatures, while we discuss the unresolved problem of the source of hole carriers in p-type GaN. Moreover, by taking into account the balance between carriers bound in compact and diffuse states and considering different absorption and emission processes involving point defects and defect complexes, we explain various photoluminescence peaks observed routinely in doped and nominally undoped samples.

With such a combination there is a delicate balance between electronic disorder, as seen in conventional semiconductors, and ionic disorder, more prevalent in insulators. This balance is governed by the defect chemistry of the system, which is challenging to analyse at the atomic scale experimentally, allowing computational approaches to provide key insights. In this presentation I will discuss the hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) embedded cluster approach to modelling defects in wide-gap semiconductors. I will discuss the advantages of this approach, such as the lack of periodic image charge interactions and an unambiguous reference energy to facilitate ionisation energy calculations, as well as the disadvantages. I will demonstrate the effectiveness of hybrid QM/MM by discussing band alignment in different polymorphs of TiO$_2$ (a photocatalytic water splitter), p-type doping in GaN (a key component of blue LEDs) and the role of oxygen vacancies in the three most common transparent conducting oxides (In$_2$O$_3$, ZnO and SnO$_2$).","tags":null,"title":"Modelling point defects in wide-gap semiconductors: elucidating the balance between ionic and electronic disorder","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A very long paper based on a large proportion of my PhD thesis work.

Such a device allows a controlled interaction between carriers and localized nitrogen cluster states near the conduction band edge in the dilute nitride. Varying the In composition in the GaInAs layer and the gating fields is predicted to alter the Fermi level, relative to the localized nitrogen cluster states, and cause a strong modulation of the n-type mobility. For appropriately designed heterostructures, the mobility is predicted to vary by up to a factor of three when the Fermi level is resonant with nitrogen cluster electronic states.

When a small fraction of the As atoms in GaAs or InGaAs are replaced by N, the energy gap of the material decreases rapidly; for example by 150 meV when the N concentration is 1%, making it a promising material for long wavelength (1.3 and 1.5 micron) telecommunications lasers based on a GaAs substrate and for extending the wavelength range of GaAs-based solar cells further into the infrared. However, the addition of these small concentrations of nitrogen to GaAs has also been found to cause a drastic reduction in n-type carrier mobility. The reductions in band gap and carrier mobility are attributed to an interaction between the GaAs conduction band, and a set of localized or quasi-localized defect states associated with the substitution of N on As sites at random throughout the alloy. The drastically low mobility in particular is attributed to the interaction with localized defect states associated with clusters of N atoms, whose energies are near-resonant with the conduction band edge. We calculate methods of probing defects associated with substitutional N in GaAs. A gated, double-quantum-well InGaAs/GaNAs heterostructure device, in which the interaction between conduction band carriers and states associated with N complexes, forming at random throughout the alloy, can be tuned by varying the gating electric fields, is described. The mobility as a function of gate field is calculated, with reductions in mobility occurring when the Fermi level is resonant with the energies of the N cluster states, providing a possible experimental method of probing these states, which are considered to be the primary mobility-limiting factor in the dilute nitrides.","tags":null,"title":"Theoretical study of local defect structures in dilute nitride semiconductors","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"1f4cb24553577f6808a73065326a8b9d","permalink":"/blog/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/","section":"","summary":"News and inane thoughts","tags":null,"title":"Blog","type":"widget_page"}]
