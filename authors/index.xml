      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, welcome to my personal site! I am a computational materials physicist working as a lecturer in the School of Engineering at London South Bank University. I am interested in how charge carriers interact with defects in crystalline systems, in particular semiconductors. My work focuses on materials used in energy applications and high power microelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a Corconian, exiled to the UK. I studied physics at University College Cork, gaining a first class BSc degree in 2004 and, after a few years wandering the wilderness, returned there to work on my PhD under the supervision of Professor Stephen Fahy. We developed a method to probe complex defect states in dilute nitride semiconductors using carrier scattering properties, which involved creating a computational model of a heterostructure device. After graduating in 2011, I moved to the Department of Chemistry at UCL to experience culture shock. I spent 8 years there pretending to be a chemist, working with Professor Richard Catlow, as well as Professors Aron Walsh and David Scanlon, establishing a fruitful Irish comp. chem. network. In October 2019 I was appointed a lecturer at LSBU in the School of Engineering, so my job now involves pretending to be an electronic engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of research and teaching, I enjoy running, cycling, football, movies, crime novels and exploring the South East of England with my wife and two kids.&lt;/p&gt;
